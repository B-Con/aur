Arch User Repository
===
These are the packages that [I maintain](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=B-Con) in the [Arch Linux User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org) (AUR). The top-level directory has a folder for each package, with the folder name being the same as the package name in the AUR. The folder contents contain the package build files (PKGBUILD, etc) that are in the AUR and necessary for building the package via `makepkg`.
